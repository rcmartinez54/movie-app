# reelGetter

reelGetter is an application that allows users to search for a movie of their choice and gets access to the movie overview, cast, and trailer.  Along with the user's choice, they may click to see current popular movies based upon user voting.

## Motivation

I have a deep love for movies and the stories they tell.  I wanted a way to connect users to movies they search for as well as give them suggestions to what else is out there.
